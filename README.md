# Unosquare CoE .NET Technical Assessment
This repository hosts the projects used to evaluate members of the Unosquare CoE .NET

## Assessment Delivery Guidance

**Priority:**  
In this assessment, priority is given to completing all requested functionality.  
Additional architectural improvements are appreciated but will **not** compensate for missing or incomplete core requirements.

**Recommendation:**  
Focus on delivering all requested features first.  
Extra design patterns, abstractions, or architectural changes are only beneficial if they do not reduce the completeness of the deliverable.

## Time Management Tips

- **Read all requirements first** before writing code.
- **Plan your approach**: break down the work into small, testable steps.
- **Deliver the core features early** â€” aim to have a working version by the halfway mark.
- **Use remaining time** for validation, error handling, and any bonus features.
- **Avoid over-engineering**: keep architecture simple unless complexity is required by the problem.
- **Test as you go** to avoid last-minute surprises.
